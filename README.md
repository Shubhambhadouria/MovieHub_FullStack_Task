# Movie Hub

To start the project we need data from backend. For that fire this API ("http://localhost:8080/movie/batch") request in postman along with data provided in JSON Format.


For JSON Data, a file is attached with the project named 'JSON Data' just copy and paste the entire thing present in file to the request body of the given API.
